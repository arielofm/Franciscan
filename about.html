						This vision can help guide us in our modern world, offering a fresh perspective on what it means to live a good life.
						Franciscan anthropology, rooted in the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi, offers a unique perspective on understanding human life. 
						It emphasizes the inherent dignity of every person, the value of simplicity, and the importance of living in harmony with all creation. 
						Unlike modern views that often prioritize material success, control, and individual achievement, 
						Franciscan anthropology invites us to see life through a lens of humility, solidarity, and interconnectedness. 
						In this vision, humans are not just creators or economic agents, but spiritual beings who seek meaning, relationships, 
						and a deeper connection with God and the world around them.

		  <p>Homo Faber emphasizes humans as makers, using work and tools to control and shape their environment. 
			Homo Oeconomicus focuses on self-interest and economic efficiency. Together, they greatly influence 
			modern society, but also raise concerns about balance, sustainability, and humanity’s impact on nature.
			<br>
			<br>
			In the modern view, humans are often seen as  <strong><em>Homo Faber</em></strong>, the "maker," who controls the world around 
			them through work, technology, and tools. This perspective highlights our ability to shape our environment, 
			but it also fosters a mindset focused on productivity and control. Paired with this is the concept of 
			<strong><em>Homo Oeconomicus</em></strong>, the "economic man," which emphasizes self-interest, efficiency, and the pursuit of 
			profit above all else. Together, these ideas dominate much of today’s economic and social systems, 
			pushing people to prioritize personal gain and material success.
			<br>
			<br>
			However, this outlook has significant downsides. It can lead to <strong><em>stress</em></strong>, 
			<strong><em>burnout</em></strong>, and a growing <strong><em>sense of 
			isolation</em></strong> as people are caught in cycles of work and consumption. The relentless 
			drive for profit often results in inequality and environmental harm, widening the 
			gap between the wealthy and the poor and depleting natural resources. 
			This modern anthropological view is efficient in terms of economic growth but 
			falls short in nurturing human well-being, relationships, and a sustainable way 
			of life.

			Seeing humans as competitors drains planetary resources and harms society.
			<br>
			<br>
			The modern views of <strong><em>Homo Faber</em></strong> and <strong><em>Homo Oeconomicus</em></strong> create significant challenges for both individuals and society. 
			They foster a constant pressure to produce and consume, which can lead to <em>stress</em>, <em>burnout</em>, and a <em>sense of meaninglessness</em>. 
			This emphasis on work and profit-driven success often strains relationships, leaving people feeling isolated as they compete 
			with one another for resources and status. 
			<br>
			<br>
			On a larger scale, these views contribute to social and environmental harm. The focus on <strong><em>short-term economic gains</em></strong> can trigger recurring economic crises, 
			deepen inequality, and exhaust the planet's natural resources. As a result, the <strong><em>gap</em></strong> between the rich and the poor <strong><em>grows wider</em></strong>, and the natural environment 
			suffers from over-exploitation. This framework, while profitable for some, ultimately creates a world that is unsustainable and damaging to both human 
			well-being and the environment.

				<li><strong>The Franciscan view focuses on human desires</strong>: the deep longing for love, happiness, and connection.</li>
				<li>It's not about endless consumption, but about fulfilling deeper, more meaningful desires.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In modern society, humans are often viewed through the lens of <strong>deficiency</strong>, meaning that we are seen as constantly 
				lacking something and needing more to fill those gaps. This leads to a cycle of endless consumption, where we feel driven to 
				accumulate more material goods, wealth, or success in order to feel complete. The assumption is that by acquiring these things, 
				we will satisfy our needs, but the reality is that this constant striving often leaves people feeling empty or unfulfilled. 
				This mindset turns human life into a never-ending quest to cover shortages, whether they be financial, social, or emotional.</p>
			<p>In contrast, the <strong>Franciscan view</strong> sees humans not as deficient, but as beings of <strong>desire</strong>. 
				This means we are fundamentally driven by deeper, more meaningful longings—such as the desire for love, happiness, purpose, 
				and connection with others. Rather than focusing on what we lack, this perspective emphasizes our innate yearning for 
				things that truly fulfill the human spirit. It's about recognizing that our deepest desires go beyond material 
				possessions and are centered on relationships, community, and spiritual growth. In this view, the goal is not to 
				endlessly consume, but to seek fulfillment through genuine human connection and living in harmony with both people and nature. 
				This approach encourages a more balanced and compassionate way of life, where satisfaction comes from shared experiences and 
				spiritual well-being, rather than the accumulation of things.</p>

				</ul>
				<p>In the <strong>Franciscan vision</strong>, key values are centered on creating a more compassionate,

					which encourages people to move away from selfishness and individualism. Instead of focusing solely on personal gain,

				<p>Another key value is <strong>contemplation</strong>, which means taking the time to reflect on the dignity of all 
					people and creatures. It invites us to appreciate the sacredness of life in all its forms, urging us to live 
					in harmony with the natural world and respect the inherent worth of every person. Lastly, <strong>love 
						and appreciation</strong> are fundamental to the Franciscan view. This value calls for nurturing

			</ul>
			<p>The <strong>Franciscan view</strong> presents a holistic understanding of life, seeing humans as deeply connected 
				to a larger community that includes both other people and the natural world. This vision emphasizes the idea 
				that we are not isolated individuals, but part of an interconnected web of relationships that encompasses

			<p>The <strong>body and soul</strong> are both seen as valuable and dignified in this view,

				This holistic approach honors the full human experience, integrating both physical and spiritual dimensions.</p>
